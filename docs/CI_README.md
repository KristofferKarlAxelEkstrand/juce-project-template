# CI/CD Strategy Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the DSP-JUCE CI/CD optimization strategy.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Overview

### Active Documents (Implementation Complete)

**Primary Reference:**

- **`CI_GUIDE.md`** - Main CI/CD guide (combines strategy, triggers, and usage)

**Implementation Details:**

- **`CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Technical implementation details and testing guide

### Archived Documents (Planning Phase)

The following documents were created during the planning phase and are kept for historical reference:

- `CI_STRATEGY.md` - Original strategic rationale (consolidated into CI_GUIDE.md)
- `CI_TRIGGERS.md` - Original trigger matrix (consolidated into CI_GUIDE.md)
- `CI_SUMMARY.md` - Original executive summary (consolidated into CI_GUIDE.md)
- `CI_STRATEGY_REVIEW.md` - Expert review and approval (archived after implementation)
- `CI_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` - 4-phase implementation roadmap (archived after Phase 1 complete)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**For Developers:**

1. Read **`CI_GUIDE.md`** - Understand the CI strategy and what runs when
2. Review **`CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - See implementation details if needed

**For Reviewers:**

1. Start with **`CI_GUIDE.md`** - Complete overview
2. Check **`CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Technical validation

## ðŸ“– Document Purposes

### CI_GUIDE.md (Main Reference)

**What:** Comprehensive guide to the CI/CD strategy  
**When:** Read before contributing, reference when debugging CI  
**Contents:**

- Strategy overview and philosophy
- Visual trigger matrix (what runs when)
- Quick reference for developers
- Success metrics and monitoring

### CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Technical Details)

**What:** Implementation completion summary with testing guide  
**When:** Reference during testing, troubleshooting, or future modifications  
**Contents:**

- Technical implementation details
- How the skip logic works
- Testing strategy and success criteria
- Rollback procedures

## ðŸ”„ Future Optimization Phases

**Phase 1: âœ… Complete** - Conditional build matrix (implemented)

**Phase 2: ðŸ“‹ Planned** - Path-based filtering

- Skip builds on doc-only changes
- Additional 10-15% resource savings

**Phase 3: ðŸ“‹ Planned** - Cache optimization

- Faster builds via dependency caching
- Sub-12 minute develop PRs

**Phase 4: ðŸ“‹ Planned** - Separate lint workflow

- Non-blocking documentation checks
- Lint runs separately from builds

See `CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed phase descriptions.

## ðŸ“Š Current Configuration (Phase 1)

### PR to `develop` Branch

**Jobs:** 3 parallel jobs (~15 minutes)

- âœ… Lint (documentation quality)
- âœ… Build ubuntu Debug (developer workflow)
- âœ… Build Windows Release (primary platform)

### PR to `main` Branch

**Jobs:** 7 parallel jobs (~40 minutes)

- âœ… Lint + 4 builds + 2 CodeQL scans
- âœ… Comprehensive validation

### Resource Impact

- **Savings:** 52% reduction (250 CI minutes/week)
- **Speed:** 2.7Ã— faster develop PRs
- **Coverage:** ~90% on develop, 100% on main
