# CI Strategy Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/smarter-ci-runs`  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Ready for testing

---

## Implementation Summary

The **balanced 3-job CI strategy** has been successfully implemented in the GitHub Actions workflows.

### What Was Changed

#### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Build Workflow

**Modified build matrix to use explicit include list:**

```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    # Ubuntu Debug - runs on ALL PRs (develop and main)
    - os: ubuntu-latest
      build_type: Debug
      run_on_develop: true
    
    # Windows Release - runs on ALL PRs (develop and main)
    - os: windows-latest
      build_type: Release
      run_on_develop: true
    
    # Ubuntu Release - runs ONLY on PRs to main
    - os: ubuntu-latest
      build_type: Release
      run_on_develop: false
    
    # macOS Release - runs ONLY on PRs to main
    - os: macos-latest
      build_type: Release
      run_on_develop: false
```

**Added conditional skip logic:**

- Added "Check if job should run" step at beginning of build job
- Checks if `github.base_ref == 'develop'` and `matrix.run_on_develop == false`
- Sets `skip=true` output if job should not run
- All build steps check `if: steps.should_run.outputs.skip != 'true'`

**Result:** Jobs marked with `run_on_develop: false` automatically skip on PRs to develop.

#### 2. `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` - Security Scanning

**Changed PR trigger:**

```yaml
# Before:
pull_request:
  branches: [ main, develop ]

# After:
pull_request:
  branches: [ main ]  # Only run on PRs to main, not develop
```

**Result:** CodeQL security scans only run on PRs to `main`, not `develop`.

---

## Expected Behavior

### PR to `develop` Branch

**Jobs that will run (3 total):**

1. ✅ **Lint** (ubuntu-latest) - ~1-2 minutes
2. ✅ **Build** (ubuntu-latest, Debug) - ~3-5 minutes
3. ✅ **Build** (windows-latest, Release) - ~7-10 minutes

**Jobs that will be skipped:**

- ❌ Build (ubuntu-latest, Release) - skipped via conditional
- ❌ Build (macos-latest, Release) - skipped via conditional
- ❌ CodeQL (C++) - workflow not triggered
- ❌ CodeQL (JS/TS) - workflow not triggered

**Total time:** ~15 minutes (vs 40 minutes currently)
**Resource savings:** 62.5% per develop PR

### PR to `main` Branch

**Jobs that will run (7 total):**

1. ✅ **Lint** (ubuntu-latest)
2. ✅ **Build** (ubuntu-latest, Debug)
3. ✅ **Build** (ubuntu-latest, Release)
4. ✅ **Build** (windows-latest, Release)
5. ✅ **Build** (macos-latest, Release)
6. ✅ **CodeQL** (C++)
7. ✅ **CodeQL** (JS/TS)

**Total time:** ~40 minutes (unchanged)
**Comprehensive validation:** 100% coverage before production

---

## How the Skip Logic Works

### Job-Level Logic

Each build job matrix entry has `run_on_develop: true/false` flag:

- `true` = runs on both develop and main PRs
- `false` = runs only on main PRs

### Step-Level Conditional Check

```yaml
- name: Check if job should run
  id: should_run
  run: |
    if [ "${{ github.base_ref }}" == "develop" ] && [ "${{ matrix.run_on_develop }}" == "false" ]; then
      echo "Skipping job: PR to develop, job marked for main only"
      echo "skip=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "Running job"
      echo "skip=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
  shell: bash
```

### All Steps Check Skip Flag

```yaml
- name: Build
  if: steps.should_run.outputs.skip != 'true'
  shell: bash
  run: |
    # Build commands...
```

**Result:** Jobs spawn but immediately exit if targeting wrong branch, showing clear skip message in logs.

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Test PRs ✅ NEXT STEP

**Test 1: PR to `develop`**

```bash
# Create test branch and PR to develop
git checkout -b test/ci-develop-pr
echo "# Test CI on develop" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify 3-job CI on develop PR"
git push origin test/ci-develop-pr
# Create PR targeting develop branch
```

**Expected result:** Only 3 jobs run (lint, ubuntu Debug, windows Release)

**Test 2: PR to `main`**

```bash
# Create test branch and PR to main
git checkout -b test/ci-main-pr develop
echo "# Test CI on main" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Verify 7-job CI on main PR"
git push origin test/ci-main-pr
# Create PR targeting main branch
```

**Expected result:** All 7 jobs run (lint, 4 builds, 2 CodeQL scans)

### Phase 2: Monitor Metrics (Week 1-4)

**Develop PR metrics to track:**

- ⏱️ Average PR duration (target: <20 min, goal: 15 min)
- 🎯 Job completion success rate (target: >98%)
- 📊 Windows-specific issues caught (target: ≥80% of all platform-specific issues)
- 🔄 Rerun frequency (target: <10% of jobs require manual rerun per week,
  calculated as [manually rerun jobs] / [total jobs executed])

**Main PR metrics to track:**

- ⚠️ Failure rate of PRs that passed develop (acceptable: <15%, expected: ~10%, concerning: >20%)
- 🐛 Types of issues caught only at main gate (macOS/Linux Release issues)
- 💯 Zero production escapes (all issues caught before merge)

### Phase 3: Gather Feedback (Week 2-4)

**Developer experience:**

- 💬 Feedback on iteration speed (is 15 min fast enough?)
- 😤 Complaints about main PR failures (should be rare)
- ✨ Satisfaction with new workflow

**Resource validation:**

- 📉 Actual weekly CI minutes vs predicted 230 minutes
- 💰 Cost savings vs predicted 52% reduction
- 🔋 GitHub Actions quota consumption

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Achieve (Critical)

- ✅ Develop PR time: <20 minutes
- ✅ Main PR failure rate: <15%
- ✅ Zero production escapes
- ✅ Resource savings: >40%

### Should Achieve (Target)

- 🎯 Develop PR time: ~15 minutes
- 🎯 Main PR failure rate: ~10%
- 🎯 Resource savings: 52%
- 🎯 Positive developer feedback

### Could Achieve (Stretch)

- 🚀 Develop PR time: <12 minutes (with caching improvements)
- 🚀 Main PR failure rate: <5% (with better Windows coverage)
- 🚀 Resource savings: 60% (with path-based filtering)

## Rollback Plan

If the strategy causes problems, rollback is simple:

```bash
# Option 1: Revert the commit
git revert 30f6b4e
git push origin feature/smarter-ci-runs

# Option 2: Manual workflow edit
# Restore ci.yml and codeql.yml from main branch
git checkout main -- .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/codeql.yml
git commit -m "revert: Restore full CI validation on develop"
git push origin feature/smarter-ci-runs
```

**Impact:** Immediate return to 7-job validation on all PRs (current behavior).

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Create test PRs** to verify behavior
   - Test PR to develop (expect 3 jobs)
   - Test PR to main (expect 7 jobs)

2. **Merge to develop** if tests pass
   - Merge `feature/smarter-ci-runs` → `develop`
   - Monitor first few real PRs to develop

3. **Update CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Document new CI expectations
   - Explain develop = fast, main = comprehensive

### Short-term (Week 2-4)

1. **Monitor metrics** as defined in testing strategy
   - PR durations
   - Failure rates
   - Developer feedback

2. **Gather data** for optimization decisions
   - Which issues caught on develop vs main?
   - Are Windows-specific issues detected early?
   - Is 15 min fast enough?

### Medium-term (Month 2-3)

1. **Implement Phase 2** - Path-based filtering
   - Skip builds on doc-only changes
   - Additional 10-15% resource savings

2. **Implement Phase 3** - Cache optimization
   - Faster builds via dependency caching
   - Sub-12 minute develop PRs possible

3. **Implement Phase 4** - Separate lint workflow
   - Non-blocking documentation checks
   - Lint runs separately from builds
