# CI/CD Planning Documents Archive

This directory contains the original planning documents created during the CI/CD optimization
initiative (October 2025).

## Purpose

These documents were created during the planning phase and represent the evolution of thinking
from initial analysis through final implementation. They are preserved for:

- Historical reference
- Understanding the decision-making process
- Audit trail for the optimization effort
- Learning resource for future optimizations

## Documents

### CI_STRATEGY.md

**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Original strategic rationale and philosophical framework

**Contents:**

- Workflow strategy by branch
- Design decisions and justifications
- Resource optimization calculations
- Comparison to alternatives

**Status:** Consolidated into `../../CI_GUIDE.md`

---

### CI_TRIGGERS.md

**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Visual trigger matrix showing what runs when

**Contents:**

- Trigger event matrix
- Workflow breakdown by trigger
- Job descriptions and timings

**Status:** Consolidated into `../../CI_GUIDE.md`

---

### CI_SUMMARY.md

**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Executive summary and quick reference

**Contents:**

- Visual before/after comparison
- Resource impact calculations
- Risk assessment
- Success metrics

**Status:** Consolidated into `../../CI_GUIDE.md`

---

### CI_STRATEGY_REVIEW.md

**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive expert analysis and approval

**Contents:**

- Implementation review
- Risk assessment matrix
- Strengths and concerns analysis
- Recommendations and success criteria
- Approval decision (âœ… APPROVED)

**Status:** Archived after implementation complete

### CI_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md

**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** 4-phase implementation roadmap

**Contents:**

- Phase 1: Conditional build matrix (âœ… implemented)
- Phase 2: Path-based filtering (ðŸ“‹ planned)
- Phase 3: Cache optimization (ðŸ“‹ planned)
- Phase 4: Separate lint workflow (ðŸ“‹ planned)

**Status:** Phase 1 complete, archived for reference

## Current Active Documentation

For current CI/CD documentation, see:

- **`../../CI_GUIDE.md`** - Main CI/CD guide (consolidated from above)
- **`../../CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Technical implementation details
- **`../../CI_README.md`** - Documentation overview

## Evolution Timeline

1. **Initial Analysis** - Analyzed current CI state (7 jobs, 40 min)
2. **Strategy Development** - Explored alternatives (7â†’5â†’2â†’3 jobs)
3. **Planning Phase** - Created comprehensive documentation
4. **Expert Review** - Analyzed and approved strategy
5. **Implementation** - Implemented Phase 1 (balanced 3-job)
6. **Consolidation** - Merged planning docs into production guide

**Final Configuration:**

- Develop PRs: 3 jobs (~15 min)
- Main PRs: 7 jobs (~40 min)
- Savings: 52% reduction (250 CI min/week)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

âœ… **Iterative Refinement** - Evolution from 7â†’5â†’2â†’3 jobs led to optimal balance  
âœ… **Comprehensive Planning** - 2,198 lines of documentation prevented issues  
âœ… **Expert Review** - Detailed analysis caught potential problems early  
âœ… **Evidence-Based** - Decisions backed by market data (70% Windows users)  
âœ… **Risk Management** - Two-gate validation ensures zero production escapes

### What We'd Do Differently

ðŸ’¡ **Earlier Testing** - Could have created test PRs during planning phase  
ðŸ’¡ **Incremental Rollout** - Could have started with develop-only, then expanded  
ðŸ’¡ **Metrics Baseline** - Should have captured detailed metrics before change

### Future Optimizations

The remaining phases (2-4) from `CI_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` offer additional opportunities:

- **Phase 2** - Path filtering: 10-15% additional savings on doc-only PRs
- **Phase 3** - Caching: 20-30% faster builds, sub-12 min develop PRs
- **Phase 4** - Separate lint: Better perceived performance, parallel execution

## Review Guidance

**When to Revisit This Archive:**

1. **Major CI/CD Changes** - Planning new optimization phases (e.g., Phase 2-4 from `CI_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`)
2. **Performance Degradation** - If CI times increase >30% from current baseline
3. **Periodic Reviews** - Annual CI strategy assessment (recommended: Q1 each year)
4. **Platform Expansion** - Adding new build targets or test matrices
5. **Technology Shifts** - GitHub Actions feature updates that enable new patterns

**How to Use Archived Insights:**

- **Decision Rationale**: Understand why we chose 3-job strategy over 2-job or 5-job alternatives
- **Avoided Pitfalls**: Phase 2-4 planning documents highlight complexity risks we deferred
- **Success Metrics**: Baseline data for comparison (52% reduction, 250 min/week saved)
- **Evolution Pattern**: See how requirements drove design (7â†’5â†’2â†’3 job refinement)

**Archive Maintenance:**

- Do NOT update archived plans - they are historical snapshots
- Create NEW planning documents for future initiatives
- Cross-reference archives in new plans to show evolution
