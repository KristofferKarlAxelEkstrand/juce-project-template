## Implementation Details

### Accepted Enhancement (Comment #3)

**File:** `docs/CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md:185`

**Change:** Added calculation method to rerun frequency metric

**Before:**

```markdown
- üîÑ Rerun frequency (target: <10% of jobs require manual rerun)
```

**After:**

```markdown
- üîÑ Rerun frequency (target: <10% of jobs require manual rerun per week, 
  calculated as [manually rerun jobs] / [total jobs executed])
```

**Impact:** Improves metric measurability and removes calculation ambiguity.

---

## Rejected Suggestion (Comment #2)

**Suggestion:** Change "->" to "‚Üí" in quick reference card

**Decision:** Rejected - already implemented

**Rationale:**

- Current implementation already uses Unicode arrow (‚Üí, U+2192)
- Suggestion appears to be diff viewer artifact (Unicode may display as ASCII in some contexts)
- No changes needed

---

## Already Implemented (Comment #1)

**Suggestion:** Add "Technology Shifts" to archive review guidance

**Status:** Already present in `docs/archive/ci-planning/README.md:155`

**Current Implementation:**

```markdown
5. **Technology Shifts** - GitHub Actions feature updates that enable new patterns
```

The current wording is more concise while capturing the same intent as the suggested expansion.
