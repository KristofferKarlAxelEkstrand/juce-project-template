# Plugin Development Roadmap: From Template to Feature-Complete Plugin

This document outlines the plan for evolving your plugin from this JUCE project template into a functional audio plugin
with a proper GUI, advanced DSP features, and robust testing.

Note: This roadmap is for plugin developers using this template. The template itself provides the build system, CI/CD,
and development workflow foundation.

## Phase 1: Finalize Development Environment (Immediate Next Steps)

This phase completes the setup work from our initial plan, ensuring the development loop is as efficient as possible
before we add new features.

### Task 1.1: Integrate Ninja into VS Code Tasks ✅ COMPLETED

- **Goal:** Make our one-click build-and-run tasks use the faster Ninja build system.
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ninja integration fully operational with VS Code tasks.
- **Deliverables:**
  - ✅ Created `.vscode/tasks.json` with three automated tasks:
    - "Build Standalone (Ninja Debug)" - Default task (Ctrl+Shift+B)
    - "Run Standalone" - Builds and launches the plugin
    - "Configure Ninja" - Reconfigures CMake when needed
  - ✅ Created `scripts/configure-ninja.bat` - VS environment wrapper for CMake configuration
  - ✅ Created `scripts/build-ninja.bat` - VS environment wrapper for Ninja builds
  - ✅ Fixed CMakeLists.txt to include `/EHsc` flag for MSVC exception handling
  - ✅ Created `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow documentation
  - ✅ Updated `README.md` to reference the fast Ninja workflow
- **Performance:**
  - Configuration: 1.2s (vs. 49.6s with vs2022 preset)
  - Incremental builds: 1-3s (vs. 10-30s with MSBuild)
  - Full Debug build: ~2m45s (same as vs2022)
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `.vscode/tasks.json` (created)
  - `scripts/configure-ninja.bat` (created)
  - `scripts/build-ninja.bat` (created)
  - `CMakeLists.txt` (added `/EHsc` flag at line 21)
  - `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` (created)
  - `README.md` (updated Development section)
- **Result:** Developers can now use `Ctrl+Shift+B` for 1-3 second incremental builds, providing a "hot-reload-like"
  development experience.

### Task 1.2: Implement a Basic UnitTest

- **Goal:** Introduce automated testing into the project to catch regressions early.
- **Action:**
  1. Create a new test file (e.g., `src/Tests.cpp`).
  2. Add a simple JUCE `UnitTest` that verifies a basic condition (e.g., that a parameter is set correctly).
  3. Update `CMakeLists.txt` to incorporate the test file into a test build.
  4. Create a new VS Code task to compile and run the unit tests.
