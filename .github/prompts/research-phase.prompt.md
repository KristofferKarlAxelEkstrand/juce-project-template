# Agent Creator Research Phase

Execute comprehensive multi-source research before any agent implementation. This prompt ensures thorough investigation
and evidence-based development.

## Research Tasks

1. **Technology Stack Analysis**
   - Search GitHub repositories for similar implementations
   - Identify established patterns and frameworks
   - Validate compatibility and dependencies
   - Document version requirements and constraints

2. **Best Practices Investigation**
   - Find industry standards and conventions
   - Analyze successful project structures
   - Identify common pitfalls and anti-patterns
   - Document recommended approaches

3. **Implementation Patterns**
   - Study existing agent architectures
   - Compare different implementation strategies
   - Evaluate pros/cons of each approach
   - Select optimal patterns for requirements

4. **Tool and Library Assessment**
   - Research available tools and libraries
   - Verify maintenance status and community support
   - Check license compatibility
   - Test integration feasibility

## Research Sources

Use all available research tools:

- GitHub repository searches
- Documentation searches
- Best practices databases
- Community forums and discussions
- Official project documentation

## Research Output

Provide structured findings including:

- **Sources Consulted**: List all repositories, docs, and resources examined
- **Pattern Analysis**: Document successful implementation patterns found
- **Recommendations**: Evidence-based suggestions with reasoning
- **Constraints**: Technical limitations and requirements identified
- **Next Steps**: Concrete actions for implementation phase

## Execution Instructions

Research must be completed BEFORE any code implementation. Document all findings thoroughly to inform subsequent
development phases.
