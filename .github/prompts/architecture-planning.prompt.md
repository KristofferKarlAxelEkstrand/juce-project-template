# Agent Architecture Planning

Design robust agent architectures based on research findings. Create detailed plans that guide implementation and ensure
scalable, maintainable solutions.

## Architecture Design Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Define clear functional requirements
   - Identify performance constraints
   - Document integration requirements
   - Specify error handling needs

2. **Component Design**
   - Break down functionality into discrete components
   - Define clear interfaces and contracts
   - Plan data flow and communication patterns
   - Design for testability and maintainability

3. **Technology Selection**
   - Choose appropriate frameworks and libraries
   - Validate compatibility and licensing
   - Consider long-term maintenance implications
   - Document technology decisions and rationale

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Define development phases and milestones
   - Plan testing and validation approaches
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
   - Create deployment and monitoring plans

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- **Testability**: Design for easy unit and integration testing
- **Maintainability**: Use clear patterns and documentation
- **Scalability**: Plan for growth and changing requirements
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Planning Output

Produce comprehensive architecture documentation:

- **Component Diagram**: Visual representation of system structure
- **Interface Specifications**: Clear contracts between components
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: How information moves through the system
- **Error Handling Strategy**: How failures are detected and handled
- **Testing Plan**: How each component and integration will be validated
- **Deployment Strategy**: How the system will be packaged and deployed

## Validation Criteria

Architecture plans must address:

- All functional requirements from research phase
- Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security)
- Integration with existing systems and tools
- Maintenance and evolution considerations
- Clear success metrics and validation approaches

Create architectures that enable implementation success, not architectural complexity for its own sake.
