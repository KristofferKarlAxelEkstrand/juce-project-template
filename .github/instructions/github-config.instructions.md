# GitHub Configuration Instructions

Configure GitHub repository settings, workflows, and automation to support the agent-creator-doer framework with practical,
research-driven development.

## Writing Principles

- **Precise**: Configure exactly what is needed for CI/CD and automation
- **Concise**: Keep workflow definitions clear and minimal
- **Correct**: Test workflows to ensure they function properly
- **Down-to-earth**: Use standard GitHub Actions patterns
- **KISS**: Avoid overcomplicating automation logic
- **Pedagogic**: Structure workflows so they are easy to understand and maintain

Avoid decorative language, emojis, emoticons, and promotional descriptions in workflows and configurations.

## Repository Configuration

- Set up comprehensive .gitignore for JUCE/CMake projects
- Configure branch protection rules for main branches
- Set up issue and pull request templates
- Configure repository secrets for CI/CD
- Enable security features (dependency scanning, code scanning)

## Custom Instructions and Prompts

- Create repository-wide instructions in copilot-instructions.md
- Develop specialized prompts for agent creation workflows
- Configure path-specific instructions for different file types
- Document prompt usage patterns and best practices
- Maintain consistency across instruction files

## Automation and Workflows

- Set up CI/CD pipelines for build validation
- Configure automated testing for all platforms
- Set up dependency updates and security scanning
- Create release automation workflows
- Configure issue and PR automation

## Agent Framework Support

- Configure tools and integrations that support research phase
- Set up templates for agent creation documentation
- Create workflows that validate implementation quality
- Configure monitoring and metrics collection
- Set up feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Documentation Standards

- Maintain clear, practical documentation without decorative elements
- Focus on actionable information and implementation guidance
- Provide specific examples and working code
- Document all configuration decisions and rationale
- Keep documentation current with implementation changes

Prioritize practical functionality over aesthetic presentation. Every configuration should serve the core mission of creating
effective, research-driven agents.
